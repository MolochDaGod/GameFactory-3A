# A3GamePlayable (three.js)

Runtime extension contracts for generated three.js gameplay packages.
This is the adapter-owned framework; it is the web counterpart of the
UE5 `A3GamePlayable` plugin.

Install it with the public adapter API, never by copying files:

```python
from engine_adapters.three_js import ThreeClient

three = ThreeClient(project_path="/path/to/project")
three.plugin.install_framework()
```

## Reusable gameplay systems

The framework now exposes opt-in gameplay helpers for projects that want
shared controller and casting logic without rebuilding them from scratch:

- `A3GameThirdPersonController` - camera-relative movement, jump, gravity,
  and facing integration against `A3GameCollisionProbe` (or terrain height).
- `A3GameLinearSpellCaster` - straight-line projectile casting with
  sweep-based hit detection, pierce limits, expiry events, and optional
  `combatResources` gating for cast costs.
- `A3GameElementalBendingCaster` - elemental projectile casting with
  direction bending (`rotateTowards`), per-element tuning (`fire`,
  `water`, `air`, `earth`, `lightning`, `arcane`), and cast costs that
  map to combat resources such as `mana`, `focus`, and `elementalCharge`.
- `A3GameCombatResourceState` - a tiny resource pool for a game's combat
  budget, including regen and affordability checks for spell casts.

These systems are reusable building blocks. Game packages still own concrete
rules, VFX, status effects, and presentation, while the resource model here
keeps the cast layer predictable and testable.

Deep imports into `src/` are not part of the contract. `three` is a peer
dependency supplied by the host project.

## Choosing a collision primitive

three.js ships no physics engine, so `A3GameCollisionProbe` supplies the
primitives every generated game needs. Picking the wrong one is the most
common gameplay bug:

| Question | Primitive |
| --- | --- |
| What is under me? | `sampleGround` |
| Can I move there? | `resolveMove` / `stepCharacter` |
| What did I shoot, instantly? | `hitscan` |
| What is **near** me? | `overlapSphere` |
| Where did my projectile go this frame? | `sweepSphere` |

`overlapSphere` treats a target with no geometry as a point at its world
position, so bare `Object3D` markers work as triggers. `sweepSphere`
tests the whole travelled segment, so a fast projectile cannot tunnel
through a thin wall.

## Cameras

`A3GameRuntimeHost` supports both projections. Pass
`cameraType: 'orthographic'` (with `frustumHeight`) for a side-scrolling
or isometric game, or switch at runtime with `useOrthographicCamera()` /
`usePerspectiveCamera()`. `setFrustumHeight()` rescales an orthographic
view cheaply enough to call every frame.

For a first-person game that derives `yaw`/`pitch` from the input frame,
use `requestPointerLock()` rather than `attachPointerLockControls()`:
`PointerLockControls` writes the camera itself, and two authors fighting
over one camera produces jitter.

## Looking good without art

three.js ships no models, so a generated game's appearance comes from
these calls rather than from finding an asset:

```js
host.setEnvironment({
  preset: 'sky',                // or 'room' for an interior
  sunPosition: sunDirection,
  toneMapping: 'ACESFilmicToneMapping',
  toneMappingExposure: 0.7,
});
host.add(createSunLight({ radius: 120 }), 'lights');   // fitted shadows
host.add(createFillLight(), 'lights');
const prop = createRoundedBox({ width: 2, depth: 4, preset: 'painted_metal' });
```

`setEnvironment({ preset })` generates image-based lighting on the GPU
from `RoomEnvironment` or the `Sky` shader — no `.hdr` file, no licence.
It matters more than any other single call: without an environment map a
PBR material has nothing to reflect and reads as flat plastic no matter
how it is lit.

`createSunLight` exists because the stock `DirectionalLight` shadow
camera is a 10-metre box at the origin, so a large map gets no shadow at
all; it also prefers `normalBias`, which scales with the geometry, over a
flat `bias` that is only correct at one distance.

`A3GameMaterialPreset` keeps materials physically honest: a surface is a
conductor or it is not, so dielectrics stay at `metalness: 0` and get
their shine from `clearcoat`.

## Imported models

`GLTFLoader` output is never scene-ready, so both loading helpers run
`prepareModel` for you:

```js
// Build-from-scratch content: use the model, or the primitive version.
const built = await assets.instantiateOrBuild('robot_expressive',
  () => buildPrimitiveBody(), { height: 1.8, ground: true });

// Existing content being upgraded.
const loaded = await assets.tryInstantiate('fox', { height: 0.85 });
if (loaded) entity.setVisual(loaded.object, loaded.animations);
```

Two problems have no glTF-level solution and are handled there:

- **scale** — every model arrives in the author's unit of choice, so
  normalise with `height` rather than a magic constant. When the adapter
  recorded a `scale_hint_metres`, it is used as the default;
- **shadows** — glTF cannot express `castShadow`, so every mesh loads
  with it false.

A third has no glTF-level solution either, and unlike the other two it
cannot even be detected:

- **facing** — a model authored facing +Z and the same model facing -Z
  produce identical files. The framework's convention is **local forward
  = -Z**, matching `Math.atan2(-x, -z)`, and the manifest's
  `orientation.forward_axis` says which way the model actually faces. The
  correction is applied to the model inside a wrapper `Group`, and the
  wrapper is what you receive — so assigning `visual.rotation.y` for
  gameplay facing cannot undo it. Override with
  `{ forwardAxis: '+x' }`, or opt out with `{ orient: false }`.

  ```js
  // Equivalent, when a game knows better than the manifest:
  orientModel(model, { forwardAxis: '+z' });        // rotates in place
  forwardAxisYaw('+z');                            // → Math.PI
  ```

  With nothing recorded, nothing rotates: an unannotated asset behaves
  exactly as it did before this existed.

Set `frustumCulled: false` on a skinned character, which is otherwise
culled on its bind-pose bounds and blinks out at the screen edge.

## Many copies of one model

A character is one model; scenery is seventy-four trees, and instantiating
a generated body per placement is what makes a generated game slow rather
than merely plain — seventy-four draw calls and seventy-four copies of
tens of thousands of triangles.

```js
const loaded = await assets.tryInstantiate('explorer_pine', { height: 9 });
const trees = createInstancedFromModel(loaded.object, placements.length);
if (trees) {
  placements.forEach((holder, index) => {
    trees.setMatrixAt(index, matrixFor(holder));
    holder.visible = false;       // keep it as the collision volume
  });
  trees.instanceMatrix.needsUpdate = true;
  host.add(trees, 'environment');
}
```

`createInstancedFromModel` bakes the source model's transform into the
geometry, so a model already fitted with `height` keeps its metre size and
each instance matrix only says where a copy goes. It returns `null` for
skinned or multi-part models instead of flattening them — losing a
skeleton is not something to discover at runtime — so the caller keeps
whatever it was drawing.

Hiding the primitive rather than removing it is the point: `Raycaster`
does not test `visible` and `Mesh.raycast` only needs a material, so an
invisible box still blocks movement and stops a hitscan, far more cheaply
than the art would. Cover that looks solid stays solid.

## Tick ordering

`A3GameRuntimeSubsystem.onWorldBeginPlay()` installs the tick that
delivers queued input to entities. Register `input.pipeToSession()` — and
any AI that enqueues frames — *before* it, or every input frame arrives
one frame late. `bootA3GameRuntime({ autoBeginPlay: false })` hands that
ordering to the game.

## Assets are optional

`A3GameAssetLibrary.load()` tolerates a missing manifest and records the
reason in `warnings`, because a procedurally built game imports nothing.
Check `assets.available` before reaching for an artifact, or pass
`requireManifest: true` when the game genuinely cannot run without
imported content.

## What the framework owns

| Layer | Responsibility |
| --- | --- |
| `data-types/` | Generic runtime data contract, identical wire format across Python and the browser |
| `interfaces/` | The three contracts generated gameplay implements |
| `components/` | Runtime identity and entity state attached to a `THREE.Object3D` |
| `subsystems/` | Session ownership, input arbitration, runtime coordination |
| `engine/` | Renderer, frame loop, asset manifest, world scene graph, input, animation, raycast probes, HUD, control channel |

## What the framework does not own

No Character, Pawn, Controller, GameMode, HUD content, weapon, vehicle,
combat rule, scoring rule, or game-specific input mapping. Generated
Gameplay Packages own all of that.

## Minimal generated gameplay

```js
import * as THREE from 'three';
import {
  A3GameControllableEntity,
  A3GameEntityFactory,
  A3GameRuntimeEntityComponent,
} from '@a3game/playable';

class MyPawn extends A3GameControllableEntity {
  constructor(object) {
    super();
    this.object = object;
    this.runtime = new A3GameRuntimeEntityComponent(object);
  }

  getRuntimeEntityId() {
    return this.runtime.entityId;
  }

  setRuntimeEntityId(entityId) {
    this.runtime.setRuntimeEntityId(entityId);
  }

  applyRuntimeInput(inputState) {
    // Concrete movement rules belong here, not in the framework.
    return this.runtime.applyRuntimeInput(inputState);
  }

  getRuntimeSnapshot() {
    return this.runtime.getRuntimeSnapshot();
  }
}

export class MyEntityFactory extends A3GameEntityFactory {
  async spawnRuntimeEntity(request, { host, assets }) {
    const { object } = await assets.instantiate(
      request.parameters.avatarArtifactId,
    );
    host.add(object, 'entities');
    return new MyPawn(object);
  }
}
```

## Resource discipline

three.js never frees GPU memory automatically. Every entity must release
its own geometry, materials, and textures; `disposeObject3D(root)` does
the traversal. Forgetting this is the most common failure in generated
web games.

A second, quieter trap: a raycast reads `matrixWorld`, and the renderer
only refreshes it at render time. An object that spawns or moves and is
probed in the same frame must call `object.updateMatrixWorld(true)`
first, or it is tested at the origin.
